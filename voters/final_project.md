In addition, you should create a final_project.md document in your folder and describe what the app is designed to do and provide a summary of the development process (which you can build using your previous updates). You also should have a section devoted to features you didn't get to build but would have liked to and any blockers that prevented you from doing so

# Who Votes In Maryland? 
"Who Votes In Maryland?" is a news app based on a statewide voter file for the State of Maryland. This voter file provided our group information to the party affiliation, gender, age, and address of every voter in Maryland, giving us a unique opprtunity to look at the demographics of voters in the 2020 and 2024 general elections in Maryland. Our news app showcases differences in voting patterns between counties by party affiliation, using a set of Datawrapper maps to anchor our analysis. We compared these patterns to statewide trends, and also provide a deep dive into how gender and age change voter demographics in a separate page (our deep dive also includes an LLM-assisted description of interesting trends).

# Development Process
To start, we worked on cleaning and shaping our data to be more managable - our original voter file was over 1 GB and had a LOT of personal information. We would decide on aggregating our data at the county level (we first decided on Legislative District, but found that this was too niche for average readers), by political affiliation, by age group - with our main variable of interest being a column called "voted_2024" that highlighted whether a voter voted in 2024 or not. To do this, we aggregated the data provided using pandas' group_by function. We also had to calculate people's age by using the datatime package - and grouped them into age brackets, which we settled to be [18-24, 25-34, 35-50, 51-64, 65+]. Once that data was cleaned and shaped, we were able to make statewide maps in Datawrapper that showed a breakdown of turnout for each political affiliation for each county - allowing users to compare turnout between counties. Throughout the development process, we would create a variety of files that included or excluded gender, focused on the 2024 or 2020 election, had aggregated percentages, and more. 

After, we started work on our Flask app. To start, we worked on finding a way to get our Datawrapper maps to interact with text we would later incorporate on our site. This meant a lot of JavaScript focused on hover actions by users - which would laed to a popup summary for the county selected about voting numbers, comparisons to statewide averages, and more. Dropdowns were also added if someone wanted to get facts for a particular county.

Beyond county, we also added a page focused on a breakdown of gender and age demographics impacting turnout, which can also be looked at from a statewide or county level. This is where we introduced our integration with large language models - where we used Meta's Llama 4 in Groq to generate interesting and unusual patterns or trends identified in our breakdowns of turnout by gender and age. As we entered the final stages of our project, we also cleaned up the functionality and design of our news app, focusing on presenting the most interesting information to users without overwhelming them with too many information. For example, our statewide map combining all parties lives on the home page, with a potential future article easily written right below it (we envision this as where the main article for our news app could go). We have one single map shown to users for both the 2024 and 2020 election, but have hidden maps for all three parties behind a slider button - we figure that if people want to look at party or county-specific data, that they will tap in to that button. If they hover on a county or pick a county, they get a short blurb about the county's voting statistics, as well as a comparison to the statewide average. Our page titles and graphs were  also being updated to be more concise - our team worked on combining our gender and age graphs to have both male and female on one graph where possible (to eliminate the need for separate male and female voter pages).

# Things We Didn't Get To Do and Future Steps
The most immediate thing we wished we could do was freeze and upload our site to Github Pages - which would allow for an easy way for people to access the site. It seems that we had too much interactive JavaScript that was incompatible with Github Page's static nature (see these LLM transcripts for some of the things we tried: https://chatgpt.com/share/681d7396-cc38-8008-bb8a-955485a594d1, https://chatgpt.com/share/681d7387-3b68-8008-900f-3d0f654f4e9c), and ultimately would require us to create hundreds of static pages to serve our needs.

On the voter data side, we had wanted to use our same county-level and gender/age treatment on people who were registered, but did not vote in the 2020 or 2024 election. There were a few issues we ran into doing this. First, our website was focused on voters, so adding non-voters was confusing for the overall structure and design to test users. We also noticed that we did not have registration data for 2020, so we would be unable to determine who was a non-voter in 2020 but was still registered. This was similar to our reasoning behind a lack of a gender/age turnout page for the 2020 election. Because we did not have registration data for the 2020 election, any calculations of turnout would be inaccurate based on 2024 registration numbers. Finally, we wished we could look into more detailed data at a city level - this was ultimately too detailed for the scope of this project (and computationally too intense), but might be something a future group could tackle with increased resources. 

From an LLM perspective, we really had hoped that Groq and Llama could give us more automated insights to use across our website. We found that our LLMs were prone to hallcuniations and repeating the same facts across different data and visuals presented to it. Ultimately, we found that templated text, combined with some intense prompt shaping, gave us a somewhat useful dataset of summaries - but for now, AI is still not that great at data analysis. Data journalists, your jobs are safe for now.
