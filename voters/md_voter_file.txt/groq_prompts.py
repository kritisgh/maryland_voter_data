For years 2020-2024, find some quick but notable trends. Keep it within 2-3 sentences and keep randomizing the facts every time I prompt you. I also want you to create a small meticulous paragraph format narrative for every county with the 2024 election voter data. Try not to keep the facts limited to ages like 18-24, I want diverse facts. An example of this would be Allegany County: The 2024 voter data from Allegany County shows a strong presence of Republican voters, with 11,152 registered Republicans, compared to 983 registered Democrats. In addition to the small paragraph, give me 2-3 voter facts for each county in the 2024 election cycle. Please advise 'UNA' stands for unaffiliated, if there is a time where UNA comes in your response, I want you to convert that into unaffiliated. Note that I do not want any '*' or '**' in the response."
