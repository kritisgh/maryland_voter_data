## Class Project Homepage and Plan 
The target audience for this news app is Maryland residents, especially voters, or anyone interested in voting behaviors in Maryland.
<br>

### Plan
Scrollytell feature:  Three slides containing Maryland voter turnout statistics, registration statistics and points of interest at the county level. Ideally, this format would compel the user to scroll through some data before encountering the main homepage.
<p>Homepage: A navigation table containing links to all three team apps is located on the left side of the browser. In the main section, a county-level map of Maryland and a text table giving a brief synopsis of Maryland's political landscape.  A summary of interesting county facts leads to prompt: "But how does your county compare? Dig into the data." Last is a description of each application in the navigation table to the left.</p>

### Unfinished/nice to have
Unsure if the state map should be interactive or not? Might distract from the actual team applications themselves.

### The tea
We struggled to decide how to hook readers into the app. What we've presented here is the compromise. Initially, April wanted a very clean, minimal design that kept the user focused on the three individual apps that would be featured on a navigation bar (left side of the page). Similar to her design for the Chicago News App, the main section of the page would feature a map of Maryland by county and include a brief overview of Maryland's voting landscape as well as a couple of interesting facts about stand-out counties. Kriti liked the idea of using scrolly-telling to engage the user, but we were worried too much scrolling would bore the user and give them reason to leave the page before exploring. We ultimately decided to split the difference -- we kept the scrolly-telling to a minimum (to minimize user fatigue and added the homepage design by April at the end as a landing page before exploring team apps).
