## Class Project Homepage and Plan 

### Plan
Scrollytell feature:  Three slides containing Maryland voter turnout statistics, registration statistics and points of interest at the county level. Ideally, this format would compel the user to scroll through some data before encountering the main homepage.
<p>Homepage: A navigation table containing links to all three team apps is located on the left side of the browser. In the main section, a county-level map of Maryland and text table giving a brief synopsis of Maryland political landscape.  Summary of interesting county facts leads to prompt: "But how does your county compare? Dig into the data." Last is a description of each application in the navigation table to the left.</p>
