## Final Project

Olivia: This app is designed to allow users to explore how voter registration has changed in Maryland between the 2020 and 2024 general elections. 

It starts with a statewide comparison, showing registration figures by county, drops in registration between Republicans and Democrats and by year, and inactive voter trends. Users are directed to explore their county pages through the dropdown and the subhead. The design and initial map makes it easy to tell that this is a Maryland-based app, which lends itself to a county-level breakdown. 

The county pages are more standardized, with line charts showing overall voter registration changes by month in 2020 compared to 2024. There's also text to tell readers what they should gleam from that chart, including bolded visual cues. The tables below give readers access to explore all the data. The pagination doesn't overwhelm them but still provides them with a lot of data that they can sift through about voter registration. 

This makes sense on a county-level rather than a state-level because the county pages are more granular views of information, so it's more intuitive to have the datatable there. 

Here were somoe of the steps in our process: 
- Extracting the data from the PDFs, cleaning it (ensuring there were no missing rows and selecting only columns of interest), creating distinct voter gropus (Democrats, Republicans, unaffiliated, and other) and remove pages from the PDFs we didn't need — only the first page was relevant to our purpose.
- Creating graphics and performing data analysis to find trends - in all, I made five graphics for the main page, more graphics for the county pages, and April made line graphs for each county 
- Sketching out our layout and design for the final product
- Writing and editing summaries for the text that would go on each page
- Editing graphics and refining the final HTML design
- Cleaning/making small changes (making all the counties standard lowercase instead of all caps) 

Features we would have liked to include: 
- An interactive quiz that asks users whether they understand voter registration and how they can find out how to do that based on their location
- Seeing how registration changes based on demographic factors like race, socioeconomic status, gender, and age corresponds to the rate
- Doing a more detailed analysis of a certain county, like Baltimore, to do a wider analysis of trends over time
- More interactivity (allowing users to click on a county and be taken to the specific page, etc.)
