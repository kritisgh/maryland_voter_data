Our first step was to clean the data and make sure we the data pdf format into csvs. 
We only wanted the first page of data that shows the total voter registration numbers by county for each month and year. 
We also had to clean the column names and ensure it reads the second row as rows.
Then we needed to write code which combined all party columns that are not Democrat, Republican or unaffiliated into one.
This so that we are left with four columns: Democrat, Republican, unaffiliated and other.

Changing the data into this format made it easier to compare current voter registration numbers in March to similiar years before the midterms) 
to see if voter registration numbers are on track, and if they're not, which parties are declining.

Once that was completed we were quickly able to make fluorish charts using our csv data.
We played around with the type of charts we wanted and decided on few.
The Flourish visuals main task were to visualize the democratic and republican party every mid-term election cycle by county.
We made sure most charts had a intepreting what the visual could mean.
I use the word intepret here instead of summarize because we don't necressraily have an objective conclusion,
for why a certain amount of people weren't registered to votes at parts of the year. 
We could only make educated inferences with the data we saw.

With flask our site was created and there we posted the charts with the data visuals and summarize. We hope you enjoy our project!
