Dabeluchukwu Okigbo: I have made the summaries a bit more simple. There a graphs still being completed so they are not all done!

Olivia: I made new graphs this week focusing on how Democratic and Republican registration changed after the election. In total, I have five graphs for this one topic: two line charts for <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/HfdGg/">Democrat</a> and <a href= "https://www.datawrapper.de/_/cNllC/">Republican</a> registration numbers in the immediate months leading up to the election and following November 2024, a <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/ymiFl/">bar chart</a> showing differences in total registration amounts by party in November 2024 compared to February 2025, and <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/5zOiJ/">another</a> bar chart showing the difference in percent change by party before and after the election. 

I don’t plan on including all of them so any feedback on which best represents this would be helpful. We also have <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EE2RkDMOWsT7CAx5rRDMeiSMldnc0uWkEzAmDiBKFXg/edit?usp=sharing">graphics</a> April made last week showing county-level registration patterns over time, inactive voter registration over time and a state-wide comparison of voter registration rates by county. 

I found that Democratic registration dropped more than Republican registration after the election. Specifically, it dropped by about 1% for Democrats and 0.1% for Republicans. Those aren’t large numbers, but the drop was 10 times greater for Democrats than Republicans. 

I’m not sure which of the three best represent these differences, and I’m still working to figure out how to color by party and not year on one of the bar charts. 

DB wrote first drafts of some <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EE2RkDMOWsT7CAx5rRDMeiSMldnc0uWkEzAmDiBKFXg/edit?usp=sharing">summaries</a> we’ll include alongside graphs and an introduction. We will work to edit them and potentially add a few more grafs in next week. April continued working on visualizations and planning out the overall vision and structure for our app and the rest of the class. Anthony did some more data cleaning and continued refining our Flask and HTML. 

We’re still working on uploading the summaries and introduction, embedding graphics (especially on the county pages, thought we’ve established that we can insert a DataWrapper embed link and pass it a dictionary with all the embed IDs for each county), and finalize the design and layout. 

Here’s what we’re inviting users to do: 
Explore different county breakdowns through a dropdown tab on the homepage
Explore interactive graphics on a statewide and county level 
Look at the raw numbers through a table on the bottom

The app allows users to compare voter registration on a statewide and county level over time, specifically comparing party-by-party counts while being told what the important information is through concise summaries. 

Obstacles:
I’m a little unclear about how our news app will fit in with the other groups’ because we haven’t been working with them and I’m not sure if I should be integrating their data into what we’re doing
I’m not sure what the best layout is and best way to present all our data is — we have a lot of both, but we need to streamline a little and ensure there’s a clear focus
There’s still a lot of work we need to do to make this app have a clear, newsworthy peg. Half our group was gone on Wednesday, so we didn’t get to discuss during class as much as I would have hoped for, but we will work on this more next week.
